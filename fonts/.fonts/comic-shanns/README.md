# What it is

Are you the kind of person that uses Comic Sans in presentations? Do you lie awake every night dreaming about a world where you could write your code in Comic Sans where it looks just as beautiful as on your dear presentations? Wait no more! I present to you **Comic Shanns**! The Comic Sans inspired monospaced font that's coming to a terminal or editor near you!

## Update 2020

- Adjusted horizontal metrics
- otf and ttf version

## Usage
You can download it and install it like any other font.

## What does it look like?
Like if someone made a dumbass version of Comic Sans that is monospaced.
